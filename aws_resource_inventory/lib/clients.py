"""
Shared boto3 client construction for all scanners.

One botocore config owns connection pooling, timeouts, and retries for
every scanning client:

- max_pool_connections=50 — the scanner fans out regions x services x
  worker threads over shared clients; botocore's default pool of 10
  serializes that fan-out.
- retries mode "adaptive" — botocore is the single owner of
  transient-error retries (client-side rate limiting, Retry-After
  support, full transient error code coverage). No hand-rolled retry
  wrappers on top: stacking them multiplies retry attempts.
