Current Architecture:
CLI (cli.py): Defines --all-services flag and --tag-key/--tag-value options
Main orchestrator (aws_scanner.py):
Decides which scanning method to use based on all_services flag or presence of tags
If all_services=True OR tags are provided → calls scan_all_services_with_tags()
Otherwise → uses traditional service-specific scanning
Wrapper function (scan.py): scan_all_services_with_tags()
This is just a thin wrapper that adds caching and error handling
It delegates the actual work to resource_groups_utils.scan_all_tagged_resources()
Actual implementation (resource_groups_utils.py): scan_all_tagged_resources()
This contains the real logic using AWS Resource Groups Tagging API
Analysis:
The scan_all_services_with_tags() function in scan.py is essential and cannot be deleted because:

It's actively used by aws_scanner.py when --all-services flag is used or tags are provided
It provides important functionality:
Caching logic (checking cache, storing results)
Error handling with proper return format
Consistent return signature that matches scan_region() (returns tuple with region, results, duration)
Progress tracking integration (compatible with the main scanning flow)
The function in scan.py acts as an adapter/wrapper that:

Handles caching (which resource_groups_utils.py doesn't do)
Provides consistent error handling and logging
Returns data in the exact format expected by the main scanning orchestrator
Maintains the same function signature as scan_region() for compatibility
Conclusion:
No, we should NOT delete scan_all_services_with_tags() from scan.py. It's a critical part of the architecture that provides the interface between the main scanning orchestrator and the Resource Groups API implementation. The actual AWS API calls are in resource_groups_utils.py, but the wrapper in scan.py provides essential services like caching, error handling, and format compatibility.

This is a good example of separation of concerns:

resource_groups_utils.py = Pure AWS API logic
scan.py = Orchestration, caching, and interface compatibility
